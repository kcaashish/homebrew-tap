  # Neovim deletes and recreates its `nightly` release every night, so the files
  # behind its download URLs change daily and cannot be pinned to a checksum.
  # The bump workflow copies each build into a release on this tap instead, once
  # it matches the SHA-256 GitHub reports for Neovim's own upload.

  # Check Neovim itself, not the copies above. The `nightly` tag is reused for
  # every build, so the version lives in the release body
  # (`NVIM v0.13.0-dev-1596+g28ff47b8a4`) rather than in the tag.
  #
  # The version must not contain commas. It becomes the Caskroom directory name,
  # which is where `$VIMRUNTIME` is resolved from, and `runtimepath` is a
  # comma-separated option: a comma in the path splits VIMRUNTIME into garbage
  # fragments and Neovim can no longer find its own Lua runtime modules.
